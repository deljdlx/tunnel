Array viewer

You can declare new array by creating a new file located in the data folder. (there is many exemple inside)

You can click on a value to see the php instruction used to access the value.

You can edit the code in the left panel. The preview will be refreshed if there is no syntax error. The "live coding" only work in localhost (for security purposes)

Have fun
